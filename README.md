# Homu-Shapes

A collection of cute, UV mapped, rounded shapes.  

All roughly the size of a 1m cube.  
Numbers after each mesh usually denotes the width of its bevel.  
00 numbered meshes are low poly meshes to use as physics mesh colliders.  
Probably higher poly than they need to be but jagged edges aren't cute!
